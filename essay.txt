How do I archive a private offer?
Archive direct or partner private offers in Tackle when you want to clean up your offers, retire them for any reason, or if an offer is expiring soon.

* Offers cannot be deleted, which is why archiving is ideal for offers you want to remove from your dashboard.

2. Find the offer you want to archive.
3. Click the More menu option and then click Archive. A confirmation pop-up opens.

5. After the offer is archived, it will show in Archived status. You can check the status in the Offers home page🔗 at any time.


AWS Marketplace private offers FAQs
Answers to help you get through some of the most common issues transacting 
How are my AWS cloud marketplace fees determined?
AWS charges a fee on all marketplace transactions. The amount of the fee charged per transaction can be dependent on the seller’s relationship with the particular cloud provider. For more information about your marketplace fee, contact your cloud BD and/or PDM.
How are taxes calculated for cloud marketplace transactions?
Note
Tackle can provide a high level understanding about tax assessment for your marketplace transactions, but specific questions should be addressed to your cloud BD and/or PDM.
AWS acts as the point of purchase for the sale of your software/product, not as the seller of record. When you register to sell a product on AWS Marketplace, you fill out a seller profile🔗 in the Amazon Marketplace Management Portal, and you will be listed as that entity publicly and taxed/ have disbursements sent to the bank account and legal entity you submit. In most cases, this is as a US entity and US Bank account, but you are able to use a bank account outside the US, using a product called Hyper-wallet. All product sales will be run through this legal entity. When a customer purchases the product, AWS acts as the point of purchase but is not used as the seller of record. Your company will be listed, along with the product they purchased on their next AWS bill and the buyer will be responsible for payment at the time that bill is due. AWS sends this out as part of the monthly AWS bill any AWS customer receives.
For more information, see AWS Tax Help🔗.
What types of end user license agreements (EULAs) are available in AWS Marketplace?
When creating your listing or a private offer in AWS Marketplace, you have the option to use your own custom EULA or leverage one of the cloud provider’s standard contracts. Using the standard contracts provided by AWS can reduce the time it takes your buyer's legal team to review the EULA.
Specific contracts available in AWS Marketplace:
   * Custom EULA
   * Standard Contract for AWS Marketplace (SCMP)
   * Reseller Contract for AWS Marketplace (RCMP)
For more information, see the AWS seller guide🔗.
How do I change the expiration date of an AWS private offer?
After an AWS Marketplace offer has been created, your buyer may need additional time before accepting. You can change the expiration date on an offer to give them more time to accept.
To change the expiration date:
   1. In Tackle, go to the left menu and click Offers.
   2. Find the offer you want and click to view offer details.
   3. Click the More menu and select Change expiration date.
   4. Enter a new expiration date and click Update. A progress message appears.
   5. Click Check for update to refresh the progress until you see confirmation that is ready in the AWS cloud marketplace portal.
Note
To change the expiration date and to keep the dates in sync between Tackle and the AWS Marketplace Management Portal (AMMP), you must create the offer and update the expiration date in Tackle. If you created the offer or updated the expiration in the AMMP, it will not sync with Tackle. If this is the case, you can manually change the date in portal and then update it in Tackle.
To do this, open the offer in Tackle. Scroll down and click the Pencil icon next to Offer details. In Offer details, change the expiration date.
What can I do if my customer accepted my private offer, but my offer status in Tackle isn't Accepted?
For AWS future dated agreement (FDA) private offers, Tackle does not receive integrated notifications from AWS🔗 until the start of the agreement. Using an alternate solution, Tackle is able to update the Tackle offer status and provide acceptance notifications within an hour of acceptance for direct to buyer private offers. However, this solution is not available for private offers through a resale partner and, therefore, Tackle cannot update the Tackle offer status or send notifications until the start of the agreement.
Does my buyer’s purchase count towards their AWS marketplace commit burndown?
When a buyer transacts on your SaaS listing it will count towards their committed spend with AWS. Professional Service and BYOL listing types do not count towards a buyer's commit. Other commit details may vary, for more information about commit burndown, contact your AWS BD and/or PDM.
Will my buyer’s cloud subscription auto-renew?
Auto-renew defaults to “true” on public orders. Private Offers can not be auto-renewed. Buyers can update the auto-renew settings on their public subscription at any time.
When will I get paid for my buyer’s subscription?
Buyers on AWS Marketplace can set up invoicing payment terms with AWS. Any transactions they complete are subject to these payment terms and grouped into their AWS bill.
Here is an example:
   1. The customer subscribes to your product.
   2. They receive an invoice from AWS on the 3rd of the following month OR on the date/s outlined in the flexible payment schedule (FPS) on the private offer. If the buyer is not on invoicing terms with AWS, and there is no flexible payment schedule, they will be billed immediately.
   3. The buyer has net (X) days to pay their bill depending on the payment terms they have with AWS (30-120 days).
   4. Once AWS receives the payment, they will disburse the funds depending on your disbursement settings. Note: if you have “monthly” disbursements, you will receive funds for payments made in the previous month. The 20th is the cut-off date for each month.
See the AWS documentation for more information on disbursement settings🔗.
For more information, see our article How to reconcile AWS payments.
How do I know what payment terms my buyer is on with AWS?
AWS, like most cloud marketplaces, typically does not disclose this information to sellers. If you need this information, capture it from the buyer as part of your sales process.
​
How do I cancel and refund orders made through AWS?
You can cancel an active subscription (an offer that’s already been accepted) or provide a refund to your buyer for other reasons including:
   * Buyer accidentally subscribed to the wrong private offer or at public offer pricing
   * You need to amend an existing agreement in the AWS Marketplace, but your buyer is not on invoicing terms
   * Buyer accidentally auto-renewed their subscription
   * A private offer was created with incorrect terms and accepted by the buyer
You can cancel and process refunds through the AWS Marketplace. Cancel any accepted (active) order by completing the Refund Request Form in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal.
Note
A cancellation may or may not be accompanied by a refund request.
Prepare for the cancellation request
You'll need the following information to process a cancellation or refund:
​Note: If you don't have access to the info already, follow the steps below.
   * AWS Account Number is located in the Tackle Data Feeds Customer Subscriber Report🔗
   * Product ID (Product Code) is located in the Tackle Data Feeds Customer Subscriber Report🔗 or in the Order Notification
   * Billing Period(s) for Refund is located in the Tackle Data Feeds Daily Fees Report🔗.
   * If you cannot locate the subscription using the above, refer to the Agreements tab🔗 in the AWS Marketplace Management Portal.
Important
Once a request for a cancellation and/or refund has been submitted to AWS Marketplace, it cannot be rescinded.
Refund and cancel orders
   1. Confirm that a cancellation is necessary. If there is no agreement found, then the customer may not be subscribed and may not need a cancellation or refund. Contact Tackle Support🔗 if you are unsure of what to do next.
   2. Go to the AWS Marketplace Management Portal > Refund Request Form🔗.
​
​Note: You can submit refunds for $0 if you only require the cancellation to be processed.
​
   3. Complete the form with the collected Identifiers.
   4. For Additional Comments, include these items:
      * If canceling the agreement, select Please cancel this agreement on this <Date>.
      * Reason for the cancellation or refund. For example:
      * The Public Order customer is unable to be identified in order to fulfill the order.
      * The customer is being refunded for a Public Order and moving to a Private Offer.
      * Customer needs to accept a new Private Offer to upgrade/downgrade/change terms of the agreement.
      5. Submit the form and record the Refund Request Ticket ID.
An outbound case will be created in the AWS Support Center Console with the refund status. The refund status will state one of the following:
      * Completed: The refund was processed and no further action is required.
      * Pending: The refund will be processed once the current billing cycle ends.
      * Action Required: The request could not be processed and additional information is needed. A response can be sent directly to the support case. A new refund request form will need to be submitted.
Once a refund is successfully processed, it will be reflected on the customer’s AWS billing account within 24-48 hours. However, it can take up to 5 business days for the funds to appear in the customer’s bank account.
Note
Tackle does not typically have access to the AWS Support Center Console, so you will have to monitor the status of the request.

AWS Marketplace co-sell FAQs
Get help with some of the most common issues that occur while co-selling with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
How can I find my Alliance Lead?
Look up your alliance lead in AWS Partner Central when setting up things like co-selling with AWS in Tackle.
      1. Go to the AWS Partner Central🔗. Sign in if you're not already logged on.
      2. Click My profile and see what your role is. It should say Alliance lead (and there is only one Alliance lead per organization).
      3. If you are not the alliance lead, you can find out who is by clicking My company. Under Alliance lead is the name of the account with that role at your company.
      4. You can click Request change if you need to change your Alliance Lead.
Is my seller account eligible for APN Customer Engagements (ACE)?
In order to set up co-selling with AWS through Tackle, you must first be ACE eligible so you can receive referrals from AWS. In order to be ACE eligible, you must have:
      * An AWS Partner Central account
      * Accepted the ACE Terms and Conditions in AWS Partner Central under Partner Central > Sell
​
      * Validated status in AWS Partner Paths
      * At least one solution with approved Foundational Technical Review (FTR)
      * Ten submitted and validated co-sell opportunities in ACE
      * An active Partner Solutions Finder Listing. (You can create one in AWS Partner Central by clicking My Company > Company profile.)

         1. Sign in to AWS Partner Central🔗 with the alliance lead role.
​
Note: If you're not sure who is the alliance lead for your organization, you can look in AWS Partner Central to find out. If you can't log in to AWS Partner Central, you need to create an account🔗.
​

         3. If you would like more information about ACE eligibility, check the AWS Partner Central documentation, such as this ACE program FAQ🔗, for more details.
How do I migrate from a different co-sell solution?
If you were previously using a different solution to manage your ACE CRM integration before Tackle (either a different product or your own custom solution), follow these steps to make the switch easier.
            1. Install and configure the Tackle - Salesforce integration. This way, once you migrate your content, you can connect to Tackle through Salesforce and use the Tackle internal review to test submissions.
            2. Follow the steps in Get started co-selling with AWS. This automatically disconnects you from your previous solution by switching the AWS users or roles.
            3. Your full AWS co-sell history will be imported into Tackle automatically and synced to Salesforce. To link your AWS opportunities with your Salesforce opportunities, see Link and relink AWS co-sells to Salesforce opportunities.
Important
Be sure to follow every step when connecting Tackle to ACE, otherwise you may run into issues. Do not reuse any AWS Users or Roles that you used previously.
